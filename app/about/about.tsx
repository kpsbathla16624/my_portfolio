        <p className="text-xl font-mono font-bold">
          Hello! I'm a <span className="text-primary font-bold text-2xl "> Kamal Preet Singh</span> third-year student at Chandigarh University with a
          passion for software development and creating impactful digital
          solutions. My journey in tech has led me to specialize as a Flutter
          developer, where I honed my skills and gained hands-on experience
          during a professional internship. This experience has allowed me to
          build efficient, cross-platform mobile applications and contribute
          effectively to team projects.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-xl font-mono font-bold">
          I'm also a full-stack developer with expertise in the MERN (MongoDB,
          Express, React, Node.js) stack, capable of creating robust web
          applications from the ground up. Alongside this, I have expanded my
          skill set to include Next.js, enabling me to build fast, scalable web
          solutions and enhance user experiences.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-xl font-mono font-bold">
          Driven by a continuous desire to learn and a knack for
          problem-solving, I look forward to collaborating on innovative
          projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in software
          development.
